# Chapter 1: Introduction to Matrix Algebra

Matrix algebra is the branch of mathematics that deals with matrices. Matrices are rectangular arrays of numbers, symbols, or expressions, arranged in rows and columns.

## Definition of a Matrix

A matrix is typically denoted by a capital letter. For example, consider the matrix A:

$$
A = \begin{{bmatrix}}
a_{11} & a_{12} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} \\
\end{{bmatrix}}
$$

Each element in the matrix is denoted by a lowercase letter with two subscripts, representing its row and column position. For example, $a_{11}$ is the element in the first row and first column.

## Matrix Operations

There are several fundamental operations in matrix algebra, including addition, subtraction, and multiplication.

### Matrix Addition

To add two matrices, they must have the same dimensions. You simply add the corresponding elements in the matrices.

## Conclusion

This chapter provided a brief introduction to matrix algebra. In the next chapter, we'll discuss more advanced topics, including matrix inversion and eigenvalues.
